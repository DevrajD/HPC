# HPC_DD2356_Final_Project
This repository holds the source codes and data gathered for the Final Project. 
Since this has been used to coordinate coding in my systems there can be redundant files (please ignore them)

The code can be compiled by utilizing the shell scripts in ../Source/procconst.sh which can be added as a batch job.
