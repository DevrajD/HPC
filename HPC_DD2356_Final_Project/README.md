# HPC_DD2356_Final_Project
This repository holds the source codes and data gathered for the Final Project. 
Since this has been used to coordinate coding in my systems there can be redundant files (please ignore them)

Upload your code of the final project to a Github repository. In the README.md file, explain how the code can be compiled and executed on Beskow. Also, state the environment and setup (such as necessary modules) that are required to compile and run your code.
